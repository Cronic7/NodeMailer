# NodeMailer 

To send emails using Node.js and Gmail, you can use the nodemailer library, which is a powerful and easy-to-use library for sending emails from Node.js applications. Here's a simple example of using nodemailer to send an email through a Gmail account.

First, make sure to install the nodemailer library by running:

```
npm install nodemailer

```
Now, create a Node.js script with the following code:

```
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

// Create a transporter object using Gmail SMTP
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: 'your-email@gmail.com',  // Replace with your Gmail email address
    pass: 'your-password'          // Replace with your Gmail password or an app-specific password
  }
});

// Email options
const mailOptions = {
  from: 'your-email@gmail.com',   // Replace with your Gmail email address
  to: 'recipient@example.com',    // Replace with the recipient's email address
  subject: 'Hello from Node.js',
  text: 'This is a test email sent from Node.js using nodemailer.'
};

// Send the email
transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error.message);
  } else {
    console.log('Email sent:', info.response);
  }
});

```
Replace the placeholders 'your-email@gmail.com', 'your-password', and 'recipient@example.com' with your actual Gmail email address, password, and the recipient's email address, respectively.

Keep in mind that using your Gmail password directly in the code might not be the most secure method. Consider using an App Password for better security.

Also, note that Gmail may require you to allow access to less secure apps in your account settings or use an App Password if you have two-factor authentication enabled.

```
// Use App Password if two-factor authentication is enabled
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: 'your-email@gmail.com',
    pass: 'your-app-password'  // Replace with your App Password
  }
});
```
Remember to keep your email credentials and sensitive information secure. It's often a good practice to use environment variables or a configuration file to store these credentials instead of hardcoding them directly into your code.
